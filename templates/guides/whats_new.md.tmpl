# What's New in this release!

## Turbonomic Terraform Provider now honors policies and schedules defined in Turbonomic!

The provider will only generate changes from actions to entities if policies are defined that meet the following conditions:
- The [action's acceptance mode](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/tarm/8.17.x?topic=actions-action-acceptance-modes) must be configured as either **Manual** or **Automated**
- If an [action execution schedule](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/tarm/8.17.x?topic=policies-automation-policy-schedules#policy_schedule__ActionExecutionSchedule__title__1)
is configured, the action must occur within the defined execution window.

For more information see [Turbonomic policy, schedules and control](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM/turbonomic/latest/docs#Turbonomic-policy-schedules-and-control).
