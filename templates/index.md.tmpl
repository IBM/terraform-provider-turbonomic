# {{ .RenderedProviderName }} Provider

The Turbonomic provider is used to interact with resources within Turbonomic. The provider
needs to be configured with the hostname and proper credentials before it can be used.

The provider enables you to use Turbonomic as the source of truth for scaling decisions for
your cloud entities deployed through Terraform.  The data source of the provider will return
the tier size based on the recommendation Turbonomic is making, or the current size if no
scaling actions exist.  It is also recommended to include a default for cases where the
entity has not yet been deployed.

## Example Usage
