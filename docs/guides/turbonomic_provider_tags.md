## Tagging the resources as optimized by Turbonomic provider

To identify resources as optimized by the Turbonomic provider, it is recommended to add a Turbonomic-specific tag to the resources, as shown in the following examples:

#### Option 1 **(Recommended)**

```hcl
tags = provider::turbonomic::get_tag()  //merge function can be used for adding multiple tags
```

In case of GCP, use the labels as shown in the following example:

```hcl
labels = provider::turbonomic::get_tag()  //merge function can be used for adding multiple tags
```

#### Option 2

```hcl
tags = {
    turbonomic_optimized_by = "turbonomic-terraform-provider"
  }
```

In case of GCP, use the labels as shown in the following example:

```hcl
  labels = {
    turbonomic_optimized_by = "turbonomic-terraform-provider"
  }
```
