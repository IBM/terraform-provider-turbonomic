# turbonomic_entity_actions (Data Source)

The following example demonstrates the syntax for the `turbonomic_entity_actions` data source. This can be used to access the DTO of actions

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "turbonomic_entity_actions" "testing" {
  entity_name      = "<entity_name>"
  entity_type      = "<entity_type>"
  action_types     = ["<action_types>"]
  environment_type = "<environment_type>"
  states           = ["<states>"]
}
```
